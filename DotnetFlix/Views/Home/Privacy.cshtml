                                        Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these
                                        other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons

                                        and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
                                        Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                        Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service.&nbsp; Another common use is to make sure we
                                        do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the DotnetFlix service if they are already a DotnetFlix user.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                        DotnetFlix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information
                                        about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                                    <p><strong>How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?</strong>&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p><strong>To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers</strong></p>
                                    <p>
                                        To opt out of interest-based ads from DotnetFlix in connection with a resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under "privacy"
                                        or "ads" in your device's settings). You may still see DotnetFlix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    <p><strong>To exercise choice using self-regulatory program resources</strong></p>
                                    <p>DotnetFlix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:&nbsp;</p>
